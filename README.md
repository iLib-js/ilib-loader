# ilib-loader

These are ilib classes that know how to load file in various platforms. The files can
be arbitrary files.

Usage
-----

You start out by create a loader instance using the LoaderFactory function. This loader
is a singleton so you only get one loader per run. The type of the loader that is
created from the loader factory is dependent on the platform given by the
`getPlatform()` function in the `ilib-env` package.

Creating a new loader from the factory:

```
import LoaderFactory from 'ilib-loader';

const loader = LoaderFactory();
```

Once you have the loader, you can use it to load single files:

```
import LoaderFactory from 'ilib-loader';

const loader = LoaderFactory();

// asynchronous usage
loader.loadFile("pathname").then((content) => {
    // use the content here
});

// synchronous usage
const content = loader.loadFile("pathname", { sync: true });
```

or an array of files all at once:

```
import LoaderFactory from 'ilib-loader';

const loader = LoaderFactory();

// asynchronous usage
loader.loadFiles(["path1", "path2", "path3"]).then((content) => {
    // content is:
    // [
    //    "content of path1",
    //    "content of path2",
    //    "content of path3"
    // ]
});

// synchronous usage:
const content = loader.loadFile(["path1", "path2", "path3"], { sync: true });
// content is:
// [
//    "content of path1",
//    "content of path2",
//    "content of path3"
// ]
```

Files Not Found
-----------------

If the caller gives a file name for a file that does not exist, there is no
exception thrown. Instead, an undefined value will be returned. For asynchronous
calls, the promise will resolve to an undefined value.

Example:

```
import LoaderFactory from 'ilib-loader';

const loader = LoaderFactory();

loader.loadFiles(["path1", "non-existent-file", "path3"]).then((content) => {
    // content is:
    // [
    //    "content of path1",
    //    undefined,
    //    "content of path3"
    // ]
});
```

Assumptions About the Loaded Files
-------------------

No assumptions are made about the contents of the files other than these:

- the file is a text file
- the text is encoded in UTF-8

Specifically, no assumption is made as to the format of the file, making it equally
possible to load json files as well as yaml files.
